Graduation Calculator 
---
Procedural programming project done in Java meant to focus on user interaction and input validation/error handling. Calculates  
the amount of time it takes for a USF student to graduate (in years, months, and semesters), the credits needed to graduate, and the  
credits they have left before graduating. The program takes in the current year of the student, the number of credits they plan to take  
each specific semester, and the amount of credits already earned. The program also tells them if their current plan will allow them to  
graduate on time.

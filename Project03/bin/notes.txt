Final Draft of Project03 Writeup
Part 1 Section:
For part one of project 3, I tested my program by creating two files that split the commands somewhat in half and created files to document the outputs of those files. One version of the output files was with debugger statements, and the other was without them. By doing so I tested input file redirection with the files I had created and tested scenarios where all the distinct commands had the valid number of arguments ( the ones that needed a file name ) and where they didn’t. I also tested where an invalid command was inputted, empty lines, and having multiple commands. My program itself has a method to validate if there’s a filename for the commands that need it and is called each time one of those commands is found. 
Test.txt - Tested commands create filename, cat filename, rm filename, mkdir directory, rmdir directory

Part 2 Section:
        For part two of the program, I focused on the transversal of the tree so that the commands could be executed properly. Part one mainly tested initial valid user inputs, this time I focused on when commands where entered correctly. I first began by starting on the cd and create file name commands. Many of the commands revolved around the current directory so once I got a good foundation for its function and execution, I began moving down the list of the rest of the commands. It took a lot of trial and error. I used input file redirection to test my project while improving and building all my commands and at the very end I tried it with my own user input live. 
	For part two the most important thing I worked on was being able to transverse correctly through the tree so that for all of the methods, I could correctly execute the commands. I did this by using simple test cases with files and would improve them to be more complicated to handle edge cases. I would also keep a list of problems I was running into or things I needed to complete along with documentation of my inputs and outputs that gave those errors. I used this documentation and saved inputs to chip away at issues until they were gone. Some issues included a concurrent exception which happened when I would start traversing from the root directory when I really should’ve started at the current directory. Others include the user being able to add content to a file, not correctly handling multiple paths in cd, and not correctly traversing through tree for find name command. After I was able to successfully execute all the commands and their edge cases I thought of, I removed the debugger statements and tested for the last times.
Here are some examples of the test cases I used:
Remove.txt - Tested majority of commands but focused on testing transversal through the tree with commands like cd, mkdir, ls,find, du, and pwd (which was indirectly tested each time find command was called). Highlighted Cases: multiple paths in cd, subdirectories within subdirectories, files within those subdirectories

Simple.txt - Mainly tested the first half of the commands but its purpose was to test create file, cat file, and du the most. I was having trouble getting the contents to be created by the user and this file helped me fix my errors.

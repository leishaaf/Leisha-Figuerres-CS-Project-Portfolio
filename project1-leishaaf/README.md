## Custom Two-linked Song List

In this project, I implemented a custom linked list class called SongList, which manages a collection of SongNode objects. Each SongNode contains:
-	A Song object, representing a song that has a title, artist, and score (rating).
-	Two pointers: nextByTitle – pointing to the next node in ascending order by title, and nextByScore – pointing to the next node in descending order by score.

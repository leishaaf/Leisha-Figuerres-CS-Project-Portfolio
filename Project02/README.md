Maze Solver
---
In this Java program, I implement a simple maze solver without recursion, stacks, or queues. It is purely iterative (which was the challenge)  ,
hence why it is able to solve majority of simple mazes, even when backtracking is required.  

The folder contains multiple test cases used to test this program.

Neural Network Project  
A project that simulates a single RELU Neuron that trains and calculates output using the activation function. 
Class that represents a single RELU Neuron that trains and calculates output using the activation function.  
Weights and biases are tweaked based on if the output gets better or worse. Includes a training function that is  
called 50,000 iterations.

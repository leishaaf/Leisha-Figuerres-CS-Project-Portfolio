Data Analyzer Program
---
A project I completed in Java that reads in data from a txt file, parses it, and creates an analysis of the data.
I parse data of an artist, a song of theirs, and the album it's from. The program contains classes to represent songs,  
a song refiner, and a playlist processor class (with an enum). It processes the top artists of my Spotify playlist by  
genre and artist, and concludes the most listened to genre and artist.
